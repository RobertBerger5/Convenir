# Huddle

Originally created for the Mobile Computing Apps class at St. Olaf in spring of 2020, Huddle is an app for coming to a consensus on where to eat. Users simply create a room, tell their friends the room code, and swipe through local restaurants to find a place that everyone wants to eat at.

The app is built on React Native, and the backend on Node.js.

# Huddle

Huddle is an app for coming to a consensus on where to eat, or what to do. Users simply create a room, tell their friends the room code, and swipe through local restaurants to find a place that everyone wants to eat at.

The app is built on React Native, and the backend on Node.js, while also utilizing multiple different packages and APIs.
